// Where the person is, as their own iPhone says, for their own agents.
//
// The phone shares only once its owner turns it on there, and only with a
// computer of their own: never from a member's phone, never to a hosted
// workspace. It says a place in words, worked out on the phone (the city,
// and the neighbourhood when iOS gave Bloks an exact fix), and coordinates
// only when the person also chose to share an exact position. It says it
// again when it has moved a fair way or arrived somewhere (iOS's own
// significant-change and visit services, never a running GPS), when Bloks
// is opened, and when an agent asks for a fresh reading while Bloks is
// open on it.
//
// This computer keeps the last thing said and nothing before it: no trail
// and no history. Each reading carries when the phone took it, and every
// use says how old it is, because a place that was right this morning is
// not a place that is right now.
//
// Three uses:
//
//   context  a line ahead of the owner's own turns while the reading is
//            recent: "Sam is in Toronto, as of 10 minutes ago."
//   read     `bloks location`, with its age, how exact it is, and whether
//            sharing is on, paused or off. --fresh asks the phone for a new
//            reading and says plainly when none came.
//   watch    a place watcher (server/watchers.ts): arriving at or leaving
//            a place, by its name or by coordinates and a radius.
//
// Paused is not off. The phone keeps its choice and this computer keeps
// the last place, to show its owner in Settings, but no agent hears it and
// no watcher acts on it. Off, and Forget on this computer, drop it.
//
// Only the owner's. A member's device never reaches the route that takes a
// report (server/member-access.ts answers everything a member asks), and
// nothing here is told in a conversation anybody but the owner reads.
