// A place to type, in the folder the agent is working in.
//
// The agent and the person share one directory: the agent writes files
// there, and this is where you look at them, run the tests, check what
// git thinks. Nowhere else in the app can you type a command.
//
// A shell needs a terminal, not a pipe. Without one there is no line
// editing, no colour, no job control, and anything that checks whether it
// is talking to a person turns all of that off. Node cannot allocate a
// pty on its own and the packages that can are native code, which is a
// build toolchain on every platform we ship, so the pty comes from the
// system's own `script`, which exists to do exactly this. Windows has no
// equivalent, so it gets a piped shell and the app says so rather than
// pretending.
//
// A session outlives the panel. Closing the terminal in the app detaches
// from the shell, it does not kill it: a build you started is still
// running when you come back, which is the whole reason a session manager
// exists rather than a spawn per open.
//
// An agent can have several, the way a terminal app has tabs: a dev
// server in one, the tests in another, git in a third. Each is its own
// shell with its own id, and they are kept in the order they were opened,
// which is the order the tabs are drawn in. The first one is also what
// the older single-shell routes mean by "the agent's terminal", so a
// client that only knows about one keeps working against the first tab.
